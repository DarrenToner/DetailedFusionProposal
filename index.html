                        <p>
                            Thank you for considering Leviathan Studios Ltd. for the redevelopment of the Fusion Antibodies website.
                            We are excited by the opportunity to build upon the strong foundation you have already established.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our goal is to create a modern, fast, accessible, and SEO-friendly website that not only looks exceptional
                            but also performs at the highest standards across all devices. We aim to preserve the integrity of your existing
                            content, enhance your online presence, and ensure that the website is as future-proof as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This document outlines the full scope of the project, including technical details, timelines, responsibilities,
                            and costs, to ensure clarity and confidence at every stage of the process.

                        <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project will involve a full rebuild of the Fusion Antibodies website on a modern WordPress framework, 
                            while carefully retaining the existing content, structure, and essential functionalities.
                        </p>
                        <p>The core scope of work includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Building a new custom theme to replace the current outdated theme.</li>
                            <li>Preserving existing content, imagery, and necessary plugins where appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Creating a dedicated landing page template for new services and market segments.</li>
                            <li>Ensuring best practices for mobile responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and SEO.</li>
                            <li>Optimising performance, including page load times and server response speeds.</li>
                            <li>Maintaining all necessary external links, including the Investor Hub, without interference.</li>
                            <li>Implementing a user-friendly CMS experience, allowing staff to update content with ease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If access to the current website backend reveals additional technical dependencies or complexities,
                            we will adapt the rebuild strategy accordingly. In rare cases where integrations are deeply tied to 
                            the current theme or plugins, a skeleton rebuild approach will be taken: stripping the site back to 
                            its essential structure and rebuilding outward while maintaining core functionality.
                        </p>

                            <li>Integration of client-provided content, or migration of existing content as placeholders where new content is pending.</li>
                            <li>Setup of clean, editor-friendly interfaces, allowing for easy updates through WordPress without technical expertise.</li>
                            <li>Careful preservation of any existing important functionality and external links, particularly the Investor Hub, which will be linked externally but not altered.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h3>Accessibility and Best Practices</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attention to accessibility guidelines (contrast, font sizes, alt text) to promote an inclusive browsing experience.</li>
                            <li>Optimisation of site speed, including best practice caching, asset minification, and global content delivery via Cloudflare.</li>

                        <p>This approach ensures a professional, polished website that supports the business now and into the future, while allowing easy growth and changes as needed.</p>

                            <li>Migration of all current live pages, blog posts, media files, and downloadable documents.</li>
                            <li>Preservation of existing page URLs wherever possible to minimise disruption to SEO and user bookmarks.</li>

                            <li>All content will be treated as placeholders unless updated copy is provided during the project.</li>
                            <li>Large blocks of content will be restructured for improved readability and accessibility if needed, without altering the substance.</li>
                            <li>No rewriting of technical or scientific text will be undertaken without explicit client instruction, to ensure accuracy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h3>Landing Pages</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We will create a flexible landing page template that can be duplicated and populated with tailored copy and images for each new service offering.</li>
                            <li>A flexible landing page template will be created, allowing for the addition of multiple new service pages or market-specific landing pages as needed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>This careful migration process ensures that the existing content remains a strong foundation while the new structure and design elevate the site’s overall performance and presentation.</p>

                            Upon final payment, full ownership of the completed website will transfer to Fusion Antibodies.
                            This includes all custom themes, templates, and content developed specifically for the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The client will be provided with administrative access to the WordPress installation, allowing complete control 
                            over content management, plugin management, and future development if desired.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leviathan Studios Ltd. retains no ongoing claim to the website once handed over, unless a separate maintenance or support agreement is in place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please note that while administrative access will be granted, clients are advised to use caution when making significant changes (such as installing new plugins or editing core settings). 
                            Any client-initiated changes made after handover that affect site functionality or performance are not covered under the initial build agreement. 
                            Ongoing support is available separately if required.

                            This proposal covers the full scope of work as outlined. Should additional features, major new pages, or substantial changes 
                            be requested after the initial agreement, these will be quoted and agreed separately before any additional work is undertaken.
                        </p>

                            Minor adjustments during the design and review stages (within the agreed rounds of revisions) are included.
                            However, any significant changes to the project brief after approval of designs or commencement of development will be treated as additional work.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            <li>Development of custom functionality beyond the agreed scope</li>
                            <li>Creation of additional templates or complex page layouts</li>
                            <li>Integration of third-party systems not discussed during the initial brief</li>
                            <li>Extensive content rewriting, SEO copywriting, or strategy planning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Any additional work will be discussed openly, with clear pricing and timelines, before proceeding.

                        <p>
                            To secure project time and resources, a deposit of 50% of the total project cost (£3,500) is required before commencement of any work.
                            The remaining 50% balance will be due upon completion of the website and before the final launch to the live domain.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> £1,750 payable upon acceptance of this proposal</li>
                            <li><strong>Final Payment:</strong> £1,750 payable once development is completed and client approval is given</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Hosting fees will commence only after the first year (the first 12 months of hosting are included free of charge). 
                            Hosting thereafter will be billed monthly at the agreed rate depending on traffic levels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Invoices will be issued electronically and are payable within 14 days of the invoice date unless otherwise agreed.
                            Late payment may delay the project timeline and final launch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please note: the initial deposit is non-refundable once development has commenced, as project time and resource allocation begin immediately upon booking.

                            At Leviathan Studios Ltd, we believe a great website should not only look impressive but work intelligently to support your organisation’s goals.
                            This proposal outlines a structured and collaborative plan to deliver a modern, accessible, SEO-friendly, and future-ready site for Fusion Antibodies.

                            If you are happy with the details outlined, we would be delighted to proceed. To secure your slot and begin the design and planning phase, 
                            a 50% deposit (£1,750) is required. An invoice for this amount has been issued separately, and includes full payment instructions.

                            Once payment is received, your project start date will be confirmed, and we’ll begin preparing key assets and initial mock-ups for your approval. 
                            If there are any final questions or clarifications you’d like to discuss beforehand, we’re more than happy to arrange a quick call.
